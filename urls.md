These are the direct URLs to various Scratch extensions. They can be used to load an extension by clicking the **Load Experimental Extension** button under **More Blocks**.

![]({{ "/assets/load-ext.png" | relative_url }})

Copy a URL by clicking the {% include btn-sample.ext %} button to the right.

You can also use these URLs to automatically load certain extensions into ScratchX. To do this, just append url=*EXTENSION_URL* to http://scratchx.org/ for each extension you wish to load.

For example, to automatically load the Circuit Playground and Spotify extensions I would use the following URL:

`http://scratchx.org/?url=https://khanning.github.io/circuit-playground-scratch/circuitplayground_hid_extension.js&url=https://ericrosenbaum.github.io/spotify-extension/extension.js`

NOTE: the first url= has a **?** before it and each subsequent url= is separated by a **&**
